<h1>Caesar Cipher</h1>
A simple implementation of the Caesar cipher, a classic encryption technique used to encode and decode messages.

Overview
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This project provides a basic command-line tool to encode and decode messages using this method.

Features
Encode Messages: Encrypt plaintext using a specified shift value.
Decode Messages: Decrypt ciphertext using the same shift value.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
GCC: Ensure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed to compile the code. You can download it from GCC official website.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Bitsnbytes14/first_project_ceasor_cipher.git
<br>
## Installation and Usage Instructions

**1. Navigate to the Project Directory:**

```bash
cd first_project_ceasor_cipher

2. Compile the Code:

bash
Copy code
gcc code.c -o code -mconsole
3. Run the Program:

bash
Copy code
./code


Menu Options:

1. Encode: Enter a message and a shift value to encrypt the message.
2. Decode: Enter an encrypted message and the shift value to decrypt it.
3. Exit: Close the application.
Example

3. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the message to encode: HelloWorld
Enter the shift value: 3
Encoded message: KhoorZruog
Code Explanation
caesar_encrypt: Encrypts the given message using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
caesar_decrypt: Decrypts the given message by calling caesar_encrypt with a negative shift value.
main: Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the program.
